# Foundations

We have seen all the ingredients of the foundations of mathematics as implemented in Lean. Our goal now is to:

* Systematically review them.
* Put them in the context of what we mean by foundations of mathematics.
* Separate the foundations from the syntax parsing and elaboration which help us work efficiently with Lean.
