This course will introduce `Lean Theorem Prover 4`, which is an _interactive theorem prover_ as well as a programming language and use it for various aspects of _proofs and programs_:

* Using programs (_interactive theorem provers_) to
    * verify proofs of results
    * help in generating proofs
* Proving correctness of programs
* Writing programs to find and/or verify proofs

To study these things in a meaningful way, we will look at _foundations_ of _mathematics_ and of _computation_. We will introduce different foundational systems:

* _Dependent Type Theory_ (DTT): foundations used by Lean that include both proofs and computations in a unified way.
* Classical foundations:
  - _First-order logic:_ the usual foundations of mathematics.
  - _lambda-calculus:_ one of the equivalent formulations of the usual foundations of computation.
