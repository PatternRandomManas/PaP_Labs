A large part of this course is about _formalized mathematics_, i.e., mathematics that can be understood and verified by computers. Formalization can also be done in other domains: software, hardware design, networking protocols, encryption schemes, even tax codes. An article by [Patrick Massot](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~patrick.massot/files/exposition/why_formalize.pdf) gives a beautiful account of the motivation for formalization of mathematics.

Computer verification of proofs in mathematics is intended to replace _human verification_, while in other domains it replaces _testing_. So the reasons for formalizing overlap in some ways but are different in other respects.
